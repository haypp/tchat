### Introduction to Rust

Rust is a **systems programming language** that focuses on three main goals:
- **Safety**: Memory and thread safety guaranteed at compile time
- **Concurrency**: Safe concurrent programming
- **Performance**: Zero-cost abstractions

You can write both low-level and high-level applications in Rust!
```
